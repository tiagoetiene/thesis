abstract = {Let's face it: The printed journal format that has served the scientific research community satisfactorily for more than 200 years doesn't serve the computational sciences community well at all. The community should, instead, communicate and archive the results of its research endeavors through a venue that lets students and colleagues fully examine published computational results and critique the numerical algorithms the authors used to generate them. A suitable computational sciences journal must principally reside in the digital rather than hardcopy world and, we propose, should consist of an interactive scientific visualization tool that is fully embedded within a versatile Wiki. The basic framework for such a journal already exists within the open source community. As we show here, for example, the SCI Institute's VisTrails Wiki (www.vistrails.org) provides many features that would be desirable in an interactive, visual, and archival computational sciences journal. It's impossible to effectively illustrate the advantages of an interactive, visual, and archival journal (IVAJ) over a traditional journal through a CiSE Visualization Corner article, which itself is intended principally to appear in print. Hence, to fully engage in this discussion, we encourage readers to interact with an article that we've posted in a proposed IVAJ format. We provide instructions for that interaction here; you can also find an abbreviated set of instructions at www.vistrails.org/index.php/ UserTbhline/IVAJ. Another useful reference is our May/June 2009 Visualization Corner article.1 Here we demonstrate how an IVAJ can help that published article's printed pages come alive and can considerably expand on its basic scientific content.

 abstract             = {Flow visualization is a well established branch of scientific  visualization and it currently represents an invaluable resource to many  fields, like automotive design, meteorology and medical imaging. Thanks to the capabilities of modern hardware, flow datasets are increasing in size and  complexity, and traditional flow visualization techniques need to be updated  and improved in order to deal with the upcoming challenges. A fairly recent  trend to enhance the expressiveness of scientific visualization is to produce  depictions of physical phenomena taking inspiration from traditional  handcrafted illustrations: this approach is known as illustrative  visualization, and it is getting a foothold in flow visualization as well. In this state of the art report we give an overview of the existing  illustrative techniques for flow visualization, we highlight which problems  have been solved and which issues still need further investigation, and,  finally, we provide remarks and insights on the current trends in illustrative  flow visualization.},

 abstract             = {Color coding is a widely used visualization method for scalar data. To generate expressive and effective visual representations, it is extremely important to carefully design the mapping from data to color. In this paper, we describe a color coding approach that accounts for the different tasks users might pursue when analyzing data. Our task description is based on the task model of Andrienko {\&} Andrienko. We apply different color scales and introduce strategies to adapt the color mapping function to support tasks like comparison, localization, or identification of data values. View full abstract},

 abstract             = {This paper presents an approach to extracting and classifying higher order critical points of 3D vector fields. To do so, we place a closed convex surface s around the area of interest. Then we show that the complete 3D classification of a critical point into areas of similar flow behavior is equivalent to extracting the topological skeleton of an appropriate 2D vector field on s, if each critical point is equipped with an additional Bit of information. Out of this skeleton, we create an icon which replaces the complete topological structure inside s for the visualization. We apply our method to find a simplified visual representation of clusters of critical points, leading to expressive visualizations of topologically complex 3D vector fields.},
