\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, we believe MMS could become a
standard tool in the verification of scientific visualization software 
in the same that it has been adopted by the scientific simulation community 
as a trustworthy tool for assess code correctness.
Using a simple manufactured solution, 
we were able to reveal bugs that prevented the convergence of 
some mesh properties of two publicly available isosurfacing codes.
In particular, the by-products of the verification process, namely
a continuous refinement of mathematical analysis of the algorithm's
behavior and a numerical comparison of the results of the 
implementation against a known solution are valuable in their own right, 
and should be published together with new algorithms.

We are investigating the applicability of MMS to other
visualization techniques such as streamline generation and volume
rendering. In particular, MMS should clarify assumptions and
errors intrinsic in these visualizations, a topic that has
received recent attention\cite{Johnson03}.  More importantly, we hope the 
examples presented here will encourage the adoption of MMS by the
visualization community at large, 
increasing the impact of its contributions 
to a wider audience.
